# Projects

## Project 1: Type-2 Diabetes & DCCs

**Exploring the design of mobile tools to help patients prioritize their care and treatment**

### Background

- About 40% of the patients with type-2 diabetes have 3 or more additional conditions.
- In the United States alone, over 28 million people have type-2 diabetes.

### Goal

Explore and design alternative tools to help patients with type-2 diabetes and DCCs to prioritize their care and treatment plans and communicate with multiple providers.

### Methods

#### Focus Groups Interviews

- Used themes extracted from PEI study and healthcare providers study to brainstorm potential design directions.

#### Photo Elicitation Interviews (PEI)

- Conducted PEI study with 15 patients with type-2 diabetes and another additional condition to understand their perspectives and needs.

#### Interviews

- Conducted qualitative interviews with 8 healthcare providers to understand their perspectives on the challenges patients with DCCs face and strategies for effective management.

## Project 2: ProHealth

**Proactive Health Informatics @ Indiana University, Bloomington**

### Overview

Wielding technologies that enable low-SES, urban, and rural-dwellers to “age in place.” The Proactive Health (ProHealth) Informatics group designs, develops, and evaluates intelligent, learning systems to empower lay people to better understand, manage, and improve their health. ProHealth researchers make valuable contributions to the fields of health informatics, human-computer interaction, machine learning, pervasive computing, and privacy.

### Research Focus

ProHealth researchers work at the intersection of health and technology, with an emphasis on health and wellness outside of the clinical setting. The research is synergistic with more traditional medical informatics programs and their focus on the clinical environment. 

### Interdisciplinary Collaboration

ProHealth projects are highly interdisciplinary, working with researchers in public health, nursing, medicine, business, cognitive science, psychology, and sociology, which exists on the IUPUI campus.

## Project 3: HomeSHARE

**Home-based Smart Health Applications across Research Environments**

### Funding

Funded by the National Science Foundation  
(CRI-1405873, 1629468)

### Overview

Wielding technologies that enable low-SES, urban, and rural-dwellers to “age in place.” Many research technologies are designed to help older adults stay in their homes for as long as possible, but few are tested in real homes for any length of time. HomeSHARE is a geographically distributed test bed to design, develop, and evaluate pervasive home-based technologies for aging-in-place.

### Technologies

Every HomeSHARE home includes Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, including sensors, mobile devices, wearable devices, networking, storage, and custom prototypes that older adults and researchers can access locally or remotely.

### Current and Future HomeSHARE Sites

- **Low-SES**
  - IU - Clemson
- **High-SES**
  - IU - Clemson
- **Rural**
  - IU – UW - Colorado
- **Suburban**
  - IU – UW - Colorado
- **Urban**

## Project 4: TAIPOR

**Toolkits for Aging in Place for Older Retirees**

### Overview

TAIPOR toolkits empower older adults to create their own aging-in-place technologies with an electronic-based toolkit. Researchers have made Internet of Things (IoT) systems for older adults. Researchers have engaged older adults to explore toolkits designed for children, however, researchers have yet to engage older adults in electronic crafting to build systems for themselves.

### Goals

TAIPOR is the first project to explore how to:
- Design a toolkit for older adults to build their own IoT.
- Scale teaching older adults how to utilize electronic toolkits.
- Measure the value older adults put on IoT systems they build.

### Methods

- Observed 23 hours of older retiree crafting groups to understand new technique teaching and sharing practices.
- Conducted 6 participatory design workshops to explore older retirees' interests in crafting with electronics.

# Project 5: The Homebirth Pregnancy Journey

**Understanding the Homebirth Experience**

Almost 2% of children born in Indiana are born at home. The vast majority of these are planned homebirths in rural communities. Indiana has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the nation.

Healthcare in the home is on the rise as rural hospitals continue to close and access to care diminishes.

We are conducting a study to understand women who plan to birth at home, specifically investigating:

- Their Health Information Needs
- Their Social Support Networks
- Their Technology Access and Usage
- Their Barriers to Care

We are partnering with non-traditional healthcare providers (homebirth midwives, doulas, lactation consultants, bodyworkers, etc.) to investigate women’s birthing experiences outside of the traditional healthcare system.

From the information gathered, we will create a computational model of the homebirth experience and design interactive systems to support the homebirth journey.

# Project 6: Miscarriage Support Study

**Understanding the Miscarriage Experience**

Between 10-25% of known pregnancies end in a miscarriage. It is the most common form of pregnancy loss and can be difficult to talk about.

A miscarriage affects a woman's physical, social, and mental health and wellbeing.

We are conducting a study to understand women who have experienced miscarriages, specifically:

- Their Social Support Networks
- Their Information Needs
- Technology Access and Usage
- Experience with Healthcare Providers

We are collaborating with the University of Edinburgh to also investigate women’s miscarriage experiences within different healthcare systems.

From the information gathered, our next steps will be moving forward in designing a sociotechnical system for miscarriage support.

# Project 7: Capturing Invisible Work

**Identifying Activities that Commodity Wearables do not Capture for Mothers**

Exercise frequency and sleep are related to postpartum weight retention and future physical health outcomes.

There are many commodity wearables that track exercise and sleep, but few give new mothers credit for their daily activities (e.g., walking with a stroller).

We are conducting a study to understand how women use a commodity wearable and verify how well their activities are tracked.

We will triangulate validated instruments with wearable stats (e.g., step count and heart rate) to improve capturing the invisible work of new mothers.

# Project 7: Modern Bereavement

**Supporting Grief and Loss in the Digital Age**

The loss of a parent, child, or spouse fundamentally changes individuals' identity and negatively impacts mental, physical, and emotional health and wellbeing.

Bereaved individuals often feel lost in a fog, unaware of resources available to them and unsure of which resources could be useful for supporting their healing process.

We are conducting a study to investigate how people use technology to support their grief. Specifically, we investigate:

- Their Online and Offline Support
- Their Barriers to Care
- Their Technology Access and Usage

From the information gathered, we will create a model for grief and loss in the digital age and design interactive systems to support the bereavement journey.
