excerpt: 'This paper focuses on addressing the complex healthcare needs of patients struggling with discordant chronic comorbidities (DCCs). Managing these patients within the current healthcare system often proves to be a challenging process, characterized by evolving treatment needs necessitating multiple medical appointments and coordination among different clinical specialists. This makes it difficult for both patients and healthcare providers to set and prioritize medications and understand potential drug interactions. The primary motivation of this research is the need to reduce medication conflict and optimize medication regimens for individuals with DCCs. To achieve this, we allowed patients to specify their health conditions and primary and major treatment concerns, for example, costs of medication, interactions with current drugs, and weight gain. Utilizing data gathered from MTurk and Qualtrics, we gained insights into healthcare providersâ€™ strategies for making/customizing medication regimens. We constructed a dataset and subsequently deployed machine learning algorithms to predict optimal medication regimens for DCC patients with specific treatment concerns. Following the benchmarking different models, Random forest emerged as the top performer, achieving an accuracy of 0.93. This research contributes significantly to the enhancement of decision-making processes, empowers patients to take a more active role in their healthcare, and promotes more informed and productive discussions between patients and their care teams.'
