excerpt: 'Natural user interaction in virtual environment is a prominent factor in any mixed reality applications. In this paper, we revisit the assessment of natural user interaction via a case study of a virtual aquarium. Viewers with the wearable headsets are able to interact with virtual objects via head orientation, gaze, gesture, and visual markers. The virtual environment is operated on both Google Cardboard and HoloLens, the two popular wireless head-mounted displays. Evaluation results reveal the preferences of users over different natural user interaction methods.'
